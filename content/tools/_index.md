# Tools

The EnzymeML [Team](/team/) produces software libraries and some specific software tools for working with EnzymeML.
We are partnering with a number of third-party packages, which will support EnzymeML.  You can visit the
[Use cases](/documents/cases/) page to find out more about the first systems adopting EnzymeML.

## Spreadsheet to EnzymeML conversion

Download the [EnzymeML spreadsheet template](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bigaq2l1vynr13k/EnzymeML_Template.zip?dl=1) and fill in your experimental data. Once done, you can use our [template conversion page](https://enzml.sloppy.zone/template/upload) to convert your spreadsheet to an EnzymeML document. 

For further information, please contact us or investiagte the example sheet that is included in the [EnzymeML spreadsheet template](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bigaq2l1vynr13k/EnzymeML_Template.zip?dl=1) archive.

## PyEnzyme

General software for reading, writing and editing EnzymeML as well as high-level functionalities such as DataFrame raw data export and data validation.

Find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/EnzymeML/PyEnzyme) and [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/PyEnzyme/)

## REST-API

Our publicly available REST-API offers several endpoints, which provide all tools to handle EnzymeML remotely. 

For more information find the [documentation](https://enzml.sloppy.zone/swagger-ui) or run your own server instance via our [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/enzymeml/pyenzyme).
