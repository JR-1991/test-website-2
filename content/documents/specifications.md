The **EnzymeML** specifications define the syntax and semantics of **EnzymeML**. These documents are the definitive references 
for **EnzymeML**. 

## STRENDA Guidelines

**EnzymeML** helps you to implement the [STRENDA Guidelines](http://www.beilstein-institut.de/en/projects/strenda/guidelines). These 
guidelines aim to support authors to comprehensively report kinetic and equilibrium data from their investigations of enzyme activities. 

## Structure of EnzymeML document

An **EnzymeML** document consists of three file types: a file using [SBML](http://model.caltech.edu/) to describe the experimental 
reaction conditions, the kinetic model, and the kinetic parameters, CSV (comma-separated values)-formatted files to store the time 
courses of substrate and product concentrations, and a manifest file lists the content of the document.

A detailed description of the specifications of the file is available for [download](/downloads/files/specifications.pdf).
