# Documents

**EnzymeML** is formally defined in the [Specifications](/documents/specifications) documents below. Additionally, we
provide a helpful explanation on [Use cases](/documents/cases), which describe how to use the [Application Programming 
Interface](/documents/api) (API). [Software and Databases Guide](/documents/guide), and [Publications](/documents/publications) are
also found below. 

We are in the process of developing an installation toolkit for **EnzymeML**. This page will provide this information 
in the future.
