_The **EnzymeML** Software and Database Guide_ provides a summary of all **EnzymeML**-compatible software systems and 
databases currently available.

## COPASI
[COPASI](http://copasi.org/) is a software application for simulation and analysis of biochemical networks and their 
dynamics. COPASI is a stand-alone program that supports models in the [SBML](http://sbml.org/) standard and can simulate their behavior 
using ODEs or Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm; arbitrary discrete events can be included in such simulations. 
COPASI is a versatile with powerful [features](http://copasi.org/Support/Features/) for representing enzyme models, 
simulation, and data analysis, visulaization and output.

## STRENDA-DB
[STRENDA DB](https://www.beilstein-strenda-db.org/strenda/index.xhtml) is a storage and search platform supported by 
the [Beilstein-Institut](http://www.beilstein-institut.de/en/home) that incorporates the 
[STRENDA Guidelines](https://www.beilstein-institut.de/en/projects/strenda/guidelines/) in a user-friendly, web-based 
system. If you are an author who is preparing a manuscript containing functional enzymology data, STRENDA DB provides 
you the means to ensure that your data sets are complete and valid before you submit them as part of a publication to 
a journal. Data entered in the STRENDA DB submission form are automatically checked for compliance with the STRENDA 
Guidelines; users receive warnings informing them when necessary information is missing.

A successful formal compliance is confirmed by the awarding of a STRENDA Registry Number (SRN) and documented in a 
fact sheet (PDF) containing all input data that can be submitted with the manuscript to the journal. In addition, 
each dataset is assigned a DOI that allows reference and tracking of the data. The data become publicly available 
in the database only after the corresponding article has been peer-reviewed and published in a journal.

## SABIO-RK
[SABIO-RK](http://sabio.h-its.org/) is a curated database that contains information about biochemical reactions,
their kinetic rate equations with parameters and experimental conditions. It describes participants and modifiers 
of the reactions, as well as measured kinetic data (including kinetic rate equations) embedded in their experimental 
and environmental context. The system offers standardized data for metabolic and newly also signaling reactions 
by the use of controlled vocabularies and annotations pointing to other resources and biological ontologies. It 
enables the access to kinetic data for experimentalists and modellers. Thereby, SABIO-RK facilitates the exchange 
of the data between experimentalists and modellers, supporting the setup of quantitative computer models.

The data in SABIO-RK is either manually extracted from published literature or directly submitted by experimenters. 
It is curated by experts and supplemented with additional information from other databases and biological ontologies.
