An application programming interface (API) which consists of two libraries, the Python library 
[PyEnzyme](https://github.com/EnzymeML/PyEnzyme/tree/main), and the Java library 
[JEnzyme](https://github.com/EnzymeML/JEnzyme), which support reading, writing, editing, merging, 
and visualization of **EnzymeML** documents.

Presently, we have three application-specific thin API layers [COPASI](http://copasi.org/), 
[STRENDA DB](https://www.beilstein-strenda-db.org/strenda/index.xhtml) and
[SABIO-RK](http://sabio.h-its.org/).  They are available to download in the links below:
